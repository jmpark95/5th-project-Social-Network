# Social Networking App "BaceFook"

My previous project revealed some rather shaky fundamentals in server-side programming. So for this project I decided to drop React for a bit and just focus on the backend. Focusing purely on the MVC architecture really cleared things up in areas of: file/folder structure, routing, basic form validation, authentication and cookies. I know theres much more to learn, but I feel like now I'm not as lost as I was in my previous movie app.
